Includes data manipulation, using real-world datasets. Work with employee, project, and seniority data in multiple data frames, applying data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
Complete tasks that involved reading and manipulating datasets, such as handling missing values, splitting and merging dataframes, applying conditional logic for promotions and demotions, and performing various transformations and calculations. Additionally, you needed to ensure proper documentation and code readability by including comments throughout the notebook.
Utilize Python’s Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean, transform, and analyze multiple datasets, applying logical conditions, handling missing data, merging dataframes, and calculating new fields based on project outcomes and employee attributes.
Efficiently implemented all tasks using Python’s Pandas and NumPy libraries. The code was well-documented with comments explaining each step. The work showed readiness for real-world data science challenges by transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
